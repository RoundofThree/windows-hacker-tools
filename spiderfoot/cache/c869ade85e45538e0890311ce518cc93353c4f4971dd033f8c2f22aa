        <h2>Botnet C2 IP Blocklist</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Dridex and Emotet/Heodo botnet command&amp;control servers (C&amp;Cs) reside on a compromised server or a server that has been rent and setup by the botnet herder itself for the sole purpose of botnet hosting. Feodo Tracker offers a blocklist of IP addresses that are associated with such botnet C&amp;Cs which can be used to detect and block botnet C2 traffic from infected machines towards the internet, leaving your network. <strong>An IP address will only get added to the blocklist if it responds with a valid botnet C2 response</strong>. However, a botnet C2 may become offline later. The Botnet C2 IP Blocklist is available in different formats documented below.</p>
        <p>The Botnet C2 IP Blocklist gets generated every 5 minutes. Please do not fetch it more often than every 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>The CSV is useful if you want to process the IP blocklist further, e.g. loading them into your SIEM. The CSV contains the following values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Firstseen</li>
          <li>Destination IP (DstIP)</li>
          <li>Destination Port (DstPort)</li>
          <li>Malware family</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
          <h4 class="alert-heading">Note</h4>
          <p>As IP addresses are getting recycled and reused, this blocklist only botnet C2s that are either active or that have been last seen in the <strong>past 30 days</strong>. The false positive rate for this blocklist should therefore be low.</p>

        <p>In addition, there is an <em>IPs only</em> list available for download below. This is handy if you want to use botnet C&amp;Cs tracked by Feodo Tracker as a list of Indicator Of Compromise (IOC).</p>

          <h4 class="alert-heading">Caution!</h4>
          <p>I strongly recommend you to <strong>not use the aggressive version</strong> of the Botnet C2 IP blocklist as it definitely <strong>will cause false positives</strong>. If you want to reduce the amount of false positives, use the blacklist above this box. If you want to get maximum protection and don't care about false positives, use the blacklist below this box (not recommended).</p>

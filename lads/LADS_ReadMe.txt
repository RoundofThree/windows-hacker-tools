LADS - Freeware version 3.20
(C) Copyright 1998-2003 Frank Heyne Software (http://www.heysoft.de)

LADS lists the name and size of every alternate data stream (ADS) 
it finds in the specified directory (with or without subdirectories).

This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind!
Use it on your own risk!

Usage: LADS [Directory] [/S] [/D] [/A] [/Xname]

  Directory: directory to scan, current if ommitted

  /S     include Subdirectories

  /D     Debug LADS (I hope you never need to use this option ;-)

  /A     give a summary of All bytes used in the scanned directories
         (All files and directories are considered as uncompressed
         and all security decriptions are skipped for calculating 
         this number!)

  /Xname eXclude any ADS "name"

  /Pfile read Parameters from "file"

The /X switch allows to eXclude ADSs which have a name of your choice.
It is useful if you run some kind of AV software, which adds an ADS to 
every scanned file. The output of LADS is difficult to handle if it lists 
tens of thousands of ADSs with the same name.
Therefore you now can, for instance, run

  LADS C:\ /s /xCA_INOCULATEIT

and get only a list of those ADSs which have not been created by
the AV software.

Since version 3.20 of LADs you can exclude as many ADSs as you want from scanning.
To not need to write the parameters for every scan again and again, you can put
all or a part of them into a parameter file. The parameter file is a simple text 
file, each line contains a parameter and no white space. For the example above, 
you could create a parameter file LADSparam.txt with the following 3 lines:

C:\ 
/s 
/xCA_INOCULATEIT

and call the program this way:

  LADS /pLADSparam.txt
